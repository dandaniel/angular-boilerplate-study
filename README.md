A study of AngularJS modularity & organization
=========================

AngularJS uses modules heavily to declaratively specify how an application should be bootstrapped and how it’s architecture should be designed. Inherently, current boilerplates were built on top of it’s modular structure. Modularity (in theory) can improve a given application in a multitude of areas, such as: **managerial** - development time should be shortened, **application flexibility** - it should be possible to make drastic changes to one module without a need to change the others, **comprehensibility** - it should be possible to study the system one module at a time, **learnability** - the application code should follow industry standards and best practices in order to be easy to setup, learn or extend and **testability** - it should be possible to test the application one module at a time. In some cases, modularity can drastically improve performance by selective, asynchronous or on-demand module loading.


What architecture should an AngularJS boilerplate employ in order to reduce deficiencies in performance, scalability, learnability and comprehensibility?

Can an AngularJS boilerplate be designed to suite the development of applications of multiple sizes (one-size-fits-all)? What criteria can be used to demarcate application sizes?
